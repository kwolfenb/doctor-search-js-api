        "bio": "Dr. Toschi's passion for dentistry began 25 years ago. As a graduate of Georgetown University School of Dentistry, he has dedicated his professional career to providing his patients with the absolute best that dentistry has to offer. He is constantly attending continuing education courses focusing on the rapidly evolving science of implant dentistry and cosmetic dentistry in order to bring his patients the latest technological advancements. He brings world class dentistry to all of his patients.\n\nBy using state of the art equipment and materials, combined with a mastery of the art of aesthetic dentistry, Dr. Toschi can always provide an individualized solution to enhance any smile. He is able to conservatively restore the youthful natural beauty of any tooth.\n\nNot just a cosmetic dentist, he also specializes in implant dentistry, treatment of the TMJ (jaw joint), occlusion (how the teeth come together), Invisalign (straighten teeth without wires), and Cerec crowns. Cerec is an all ceramic, single visit, chair side CAD/CAM restoration system. It allows Dr. Toschi to create perfectly fitting, aesthetically pleasing, strong ceramic restorations in one office visit (Crowns, Onlays, Inlays). Dr. Toschi has been using this high tech equipment since 2002. He has placed over 1000 beautiful Cerec restorations."
